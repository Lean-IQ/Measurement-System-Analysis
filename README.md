# Measurement-System-Analysis
Measurement System Analysis (MSA) is a critical process used to assess the performance of measurement systems to ensure that they produce accurate and reliable data. MSA evaluates various aspects of the measurement process, including the accuracy, precision, and consistency of measurements. 

Introduction
Measurement System Analysis (MSA) is essential for evaluating the performance and reliability of measurement systems. This repository contains code for performing various MSA tasks, including bias analysis, linearity analysis, stability analysis, Gage R&R analysis, and resolution check.

Goals
Assess Measurement Accuracy: Identify and quantify biases in measurements.
Evaluate Precision and Repeatability: Analyze measurement consistency.
Analyze Linearity: Ensure measurements are reliable across the entire range.
Perform Stability Analysis: Check measurement system stability over time.
Conduct Gage R&R Analysis: Measure the contribution of measurement system variation.
Check Resolution: Determine the smallest detectable difference between measurements.
Features
Bias Analysis: Calculates the average bias between measurements and true values.
Linearity Analysis: Performs linear regression to evaluate measurement system linearity.
Stability Analysis: Analyzes measurement variations over time and visualizes trends.
Gage R&R Analysis: Uses ANOVA to assess repeatability and reproducibility of the measurement system.
Resolution Check: Evaluates the resolution capability of the measurement system.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
statsmodels
matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using:

bash
Code kopieren
pip install pandas statsmodels matplotlib
Usage
Prepare Data: Ensure your data file is in CSV format with columns for Part_ID, Operator_ID, Measurement, True_Value, and Time.

Load Data: Update the file path in the code to point to your data file.

Run Analysis: Execute the Python script to perform MSA. The script will provide detailed analyses and visualizations.

Review Results: Interpret the output for insights into measurement accuracy, precision, linearity, stability, and resolution.

Example
python
Code kopieren
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datetime import datetime

# Load data
file_path = '/path/to/your/datafile.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path, delimiter=',', decimal=',')

# Perform MSA analysis
# Include your analysis steps here

# Example output
print("### Bias Analysis\nAverage Measurement: ...\nBias: ...\n")
Error Handling
If you encounter issues such as missing columns or errors during analysis, check:

The column names in your CSV file match the expected names.
The data is correctly formatted and free of missing values.
