# Measurement-System-Analysis
Measurement System Analysis (MSA) is a critical process used to assess the performance of measurement systems to ensure that they produce accurate and reliable data. MSA evaluates various aspects of the measurement process, including the accuracy, precision, and consistency of measurements. 

Introduction
Measurement System Analysis (MSA) is essential for evaluating the performance and reliability of measurement systems. This repository contains code for performing various MSA tasks, including bias analysis, linearity analysis, stability analysis, Gage R&R analysis, and resolution check.

Goals
Assess Measurement Accuracy: Identify and quantify biases in measurements.
Evaluate Precision and Repeatability: Analyze measurement consistency.
Analyze Linearity: Ensure measurements are reliable across the entire range.
Perform Stability Analysis: Check measurement system stability over time.
Conduct Gage R&R Analysis: Measure the contribution of measurement system variation.
Check Resolution: Determine the smallest detectable difference between measurements.
Features
Bias Analysis: Calculates the average bias between measurements and true values.
Linearity Analysis: Performs linear regression to evaluate measurement system linearity.
Stability Analysis: Analyzes measurement variations over time and visualizes trends.
Gage R&R Analysis: Uses ANOVA to assess repeatability and reproducibility of the measurement system.
Resolution Check: Evaluates the resolution capability of the measurement system.
